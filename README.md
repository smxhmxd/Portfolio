How To Use 🔧
From your command line, first clone the project:

# Clone this repository
$ git clone [https://github.com/smxhmxd/Portfolio.git](https://github.com/smxhmxd/Portfolio.git)

# Go into the repository
$ cd Portfolio

# Remove current origin repository
$ git remote remove origin

Then you can install the dependencies

Using NPM:

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Listen to changes in CSS Preprocessor files ( SASS files )
$ npm run compile:scss
Once you run npm run compile:scss, then open the index.html inside your favorite browser or using the live server extension.


### Deployment 📦
Once you have done with your setup. You need to put your website online!

I recommend using Github Pages to achieve this, as it is the EASIEST WAY

- Upload the code in a Github Repository.
- Go to Settings -> Pages -> Select /root and hit Save
- Your Portfolio is now deployed.
